By default android support only BKS (Bouncy castle) keystores
But while creating keystore using keytool java utility only JKS and some other keystore types are supported but not all
Now there are following two ways to create BKS keystore :
1. Using tool "Portecle" can be used to create BKS keystore 
2. Using custom provider with keytool

1. Using tool "Portecle" can be used to create BKS keystore :

Portecle is a java based utility which can be downloaded from "http://portecle.sourceforge.net/".
But while creating a BKS keystore using Portecle gives a error some time "Invalid Key Length"
, to resolve this error 

1. Suppose you are using jdk15. Go to http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index_jdk5.jsp

2. Go to the Other Downloads section and click on download link next to "Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files 5.0"

3. Download jce_policy-1_5_0.zip and extract it in to a directory.

4. You will find local_policy.jar and US_export_policy.jar files there in the extracted directory. Copy these two files to $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security directory. (These files will already be there. you may replace them)


2. Using custom provider with keytool:
 keytool utility can be used with custom keystore provider, below command can be used to create BKS keystore using keytool:
 
 keytool -keystore new_keystore.bks -storetype "BKS" -provider org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider -providerpath <path_to_provider_jar> 
 
 Note:
 Provider jar can be downloaded from: "https://www.bouncycastle.org/latest_releases.html"
