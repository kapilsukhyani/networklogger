why cant su be executed from sdcard

1. sdcard is mounted with noexec flag that means no executable cab be executed from sdcard and that is for obvious reasons.
try running mount | grep /mnt/sdcard
2. su needs setuid flag set before it can be executed. setuid flag gives the user executing the executable to do things which he is not privileged to do.
Like su cannot be executed by everybody as a normal user until setuid bit is set on it, which itself requires a root privileges. Now how can anybody
set setuid on su itself, the answer to that question is by using an exploit for that  android version. What usually exploit does is, it forces already privileged
application/binary on system to setuid flag on just loaded su binary and store it in /system/bin or any bin directory where it will be added in path.
And can be executed from anywhere.

One of the example where normal user cannot run a executable directly 
chmod,
mount -o

before running these command user has to get root privileges that is why we call su before executing them its like setting setuid flag to every binary
which we are going to run after running su.
