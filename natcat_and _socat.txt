Natcat linux utility

Its a utility which runs a server on a particular port and cats the whatever requests it gets

A very nice article can be found here 

"http://lifehacker.com/202271/roll-your-own-servers-with-netcat"\


It can be used to implement may use cases on of them is copying file from one system to another and it can achieved as

Machine one (server)
"nc is natcat in linux"
busybox nc -l -p 8081 > destination_file_name //listens for incoming request and write the content into destination_file


Machine two (client (has to copy the file on server))

cat file_to_be_copied |  nc <machine_one_ip> 8081 // cat's source file and pipe's the output to natcat


I used it to debug iptables functionality. I wanted to check the request which was being forwarded to specified destination after performing DNAT 


Socat

its a tool which can be used to intercept ssl session by breaking the client-server conection and acting as a bridge in between
. it can listen on a particlar port for incoming ssl request and then transfer the same request (bridge) to actual server.


A fake server certificate can be created authorized by fake ca cert created by openssl and then can used with socat so that 
 lient can create a valid ssl session with it and then socat will just log the request and send the original request to original destination
which can be configured while calling socat
